From a practical standpoint, Pewlett Hackard needs to look at diversifying their workforce. The provided employee data of 300,025 employees listed birth dates from 1952 to 1965. Below is a table showing what positions would need to be filled if the company had to account for retirees with birthdates through 1960. Although not everyone retires early, I think the company also needs to account for employees who retire prior to age 67. There are 164,805 employees born between 1952 and 1960 which is more than double the total of all employees. Although there are many people in the workforce who continue working after age 67, many are done working. Given the number of employees Pewlett Hackard will have to replace in the next 10 years, 1,549 of their youngest employees would not be enough to mentor hundreds of thousands of new employees needed to keep the company running as is.
